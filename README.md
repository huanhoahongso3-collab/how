    <p align="center">A Terminal-Based Assistant for Generating Shell Commands</p>

**How-CLI** is a terminal-based assistant that generates precise shell commands for any task you ask. Powered by Groq, it provides context-aware, executable shell commands tailored to your current environment.

This project is forked from original repo: https://github.com/Ademking/how.

## Features

- Generate **exact shell commands** based on your current working directory, OS, and available tools.
- Context-aware: considers **files, git repositories, shell type**, and installed tools.
- **Command history** logging for easy reference.
- Clipboard support: copies generated commands automatically.
- Typewriter effect for visually appealing output (optional).
- Configurable Groq API key.
- Handles API errors, content blocks, and timeouts gracefully.

### ⚠️ Disclaimer:

```
Yeah, I know... It’s a Groq wrapper.
I know it's not the next Warp AI terminal or some fancy LLM-based shell integration with auto-completion and context persistence...
I know it's “yet another CLI tool” 
and yes, I'm painfully aware that wrapping an API and printing stuff in the terminal isn't groundbreaking computer science...
But here's the thing: I made How-CLI because it was fun and quick to build...
It's not meant to change the world. It’s meant to make typing "how to do X in bash" a little more amusing..
Think of it as a weekend hack.
